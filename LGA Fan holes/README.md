does Not matter if CPU is soldered, has diy custom socket, off the self socket or cpu pcb board </br>
requires cooling, and cooling requires mounting holes. </br>
the idea is to make a "Universal" mounting, as compatible as possible with most common fans & waterblocks. </br>

LGA Compatible Fan Holes for standard PCB FAN mount. </br>

The Sam460 boards use a light weight method, a large passive cooling glued + A4x10 Noctua on top, with very streched rubber groumet mounts. </br>

The interesting part is that pcb fan holes are the same size as Fan holes in horizontal position, 40x40x10mm fan or 60x60x20. </br>

The X5000, some have a similar design, but does Not seem good enough for P5020 cpu.  </br>

Other X5000 have a complete replacement of the Cooling system, with standard LGA compatible. </br>

There are different Methods: small heatsink + super fast loud/noisy fan. </br>
SilentPC method: very large passive heatsink, very heavy. No Fan. </br>
in-between: 600-800rpm 12vdc 3-pin fan running at 5vdc. </br>

Water Cooling method: </br>

Thermal Pads are usually a Bad method for High temps, specially if thermal pad is FAT, >1mm. </br>
Thermal Paste usually best method. </br>
there are more complex methods like phase change liquids inside a Kapton "plastic bag / pouch". </br>

The problem with LGA mounting: 1366, 1150, 1151, 1151-1, 2001, 2011, 2011-3, 3647, etc.. </br>
is that manufactureres discontinue as fast as possible to sell again with a different mount. </br>
it would require an investigation to know what is the most sold / common CPU / socket type, to avoid becoming incompatible too fast. </br>
1366 775 are classic, AMD Opteron 6000 is rare, Some Intel 2011 are Wide like X 1366, and Narrow, like AMD Opetron, but holes are incompatible. </br> 

Koolance has variable mount in some waterblock designs </br>
but those designs does Not have advanced micro fins for better heat transfer, </br>
just basic fins / pins, cooling efficiency is Not as good as dedicated coolers. </br>
